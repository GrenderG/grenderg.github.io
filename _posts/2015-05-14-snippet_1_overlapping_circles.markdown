Let our snippet section begin with some fresh Java (Android focused) code here! If you want to get the positions of n-overlapping circles like so:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/assets/image/snippet1.png" />

Check this:
{% highlight java %}
public int[] getCirclePositions(int radius, int viewWidth, int items){
	int[] positions = new int[items];
	int portionSize = viewWidth / (items + 1);
 
	for (int i = 0; i < positions.length; i++){
		positions[i] = (portionSize*(i+1)) - radius;
	}
 
	return positions;
}
{% endhighlight %}

- **radius:** Radius of each circle.
- **viewWidth:** Total width of the view where circles will be placed.
- **items:** Total of circles.

###What does it returns?
An int array containing the starting position where each circle should be placed.
