>In digital computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast, primitive action directly supported by the processor, and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations.

Bit shifting operations are, indeed, bitwise operations because they treat every value as a series of bits instead of a numerical quantity. With these operations you can "move" bits to the reft or right.

##What the f*** are you talking about?
