Hi, I am Daniel Morales, a software developer (Android proficiency) based in Spain. 

I got my Associate degree in Multiplatform development (Software Engineering) and then worked
as an Android and iOS developer in [Mobilendo][mb]. After that I studied Computer Engineering for a year,
but I'm currently taking a break as it's not required for my work at this moment, so I'm working as a freelancer.

### Contact me

Find me on [Google play][gplay] / [Github][github] / [Twitter][Twitter] or send me an email to **dmorales@dmoral.es**.
