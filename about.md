	<h2><i class="fa fa-user"></i> About Me</h2>

	<p>Hi, I am Daniel Morales, a software developer (Android proficiency) based in Spain. 

	I got my Associate degree in Multiplatform development (Software Engineering) and then worked
	as an Android and iOS developer in <a href="http://mobilendo.com/">Mobilendo</a>. After that I studied Computer Engineering for a year,
	but I'm currently taking a break as it's not required for my work at this moment, so I'm working as a freelancer.</p>

	<h2>Contact me</h2>

	<p>Find me on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=GrenderG">Google play</a> / <a href="https://github.com/grenderg">Github</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/grenderg">Twitter</a> or send me an email to <strong>dmorales@dmoral.es</strong>.</p>
